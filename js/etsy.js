Tattoos bring our stories to life. What story will you tell? Be a storyteller.\r\n\r\nSkin art is all about individuality - nobody knows what fits on your skin better than you.\r\n\r\nIndividuality is achieved through creative expression - while many believe differences create disputes, we believe in unity through diversity. We\u2019re all different, which means we all have that in common.\r\n\r\nArt is like science, you\u2019ve got to experiment - trying new things is an essential part of self-expression.\r\n\r\nThe design and the art only have the purpose that you assign to them - the essential ingredient in any piece of art is the observer \u2013 that means you!","policy_payment":null,"policy_shipping":"Since we here at Tattify are always living in the artistic realm of abstract ideas and the imagination, it sometimes becomes difficult to remember the physical realities involved when providing our services to the hungry masses.

Delivery can take between five and ten days, depending on how strict the customs agents are feeling at that particular moment.
